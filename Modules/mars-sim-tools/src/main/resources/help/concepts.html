<H2 class="pageTitle">Simulation Concepts</H2>
<P>Mars Simulation Project (mars-sim) is a Java-based open source project that simulates the activities of the first
generation of settlers on Mars.</P>

<P><H4>A. Modeling and Simulation</H4></P>

<P>As a general purpose computer simulation (See <a href="modeling.html">Modeling</a> for details), 
mars-sim models a settler's career background into various abstractions such as 
job, role, attributes/skills, task preferences, personality/temperament and level of relationship with one another as they
go about their daily lives on Mars.</P>

<P>Each agent is endowed with various human-like characteristics such as age, height, weight, blood types, health indices, etc., 
capable of making distinct decisions and interacting with one another and perform tasks and mission within the settlement 
and on the surface of Mars. 

<P>On a powerful machine, player may create numerous settlements spreading across <a href="mars.html">Mars</A>,
 from a simple 4-person initial landing base, or a mining site to more matured bases with buildings hosting various functions.</P>

<P>Each <a href="settlers.html">settler</A> is associated with one particular settlement. Each settlement houses buildings 
and vehicles and has a leadership structure (i.e. commander, sub-commander, chiefs and specialists) and has a development 
objective which will drives its development and production into a specialization of certain economic outputs.</P>

<P>Settlements trade goods with one another. In each Trading Mission, goods are exchanged and Value Points (VP)
are calculated for the two involving settlements as the VP system is the proto-currency or economic system used in mars-sim.
Each resource worths a certain amount of VP and the can change dynamically over time based upon the demand and supply of that resource. </P>

<P><H4>B. Architecture</H4></P>

<P>mars-sim is composed of the following constructs or archetypes : </P>
