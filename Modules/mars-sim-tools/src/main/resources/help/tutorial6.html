<P>The <A HREF="timetool.html">Time Tool</A> keeps track of how date and time go by on Mars and Earth in mars-sim. </P>

<P>The Time Tool displays the current time in the simulation.</P>
<P>The Martian Time label shows the current Martian time in the following format: 
"Orbit-Month-Sol:Millisol". e.g. 01-Adir-05:305</P>
<P>The Martian calendar panel display of the calendar in terms of the month of an orbit and the sol of each week. </P> 

<P>The season labels shows the seasons of the northern and southern hemisphere of Mars.</P>
<P>The L_s label shows the value of the areocentric latitude of Mars.</P>
<P>The CPU Pulse spinner shows the amount of usage of CPU for mars-sim.</P>

<P><i>Note 1: the number spinner above the TPS allows the user to adjust the CPU usage of the simulation.</P>

<P>The Ticks/s (TPS) label shows the average number of simulation clock ticks 
per real world second. </P> 
<P>The larger the number, the higher # of frames in a second, and the faster the simulation is running.</P>
<P>The Execution label shows the duration of execution time in milliseconds within a frame.</P> 
<P>The Sleep label shows the duration of sleep time in milliseconds within a frame.</P> 
<P>The Pulse Width label indicates the width (in millisols) of each time pulse. The small the #, the more fine grain each frame is.</P>
<P>The Pulse Deviation label shows the percentage of deviation between the reference pulse width and the actual pulse width.</P>
<P>The Time Ratio (TR) shows the actual vs. desired time compression for the simulation. </P>
<P>The Real Time Clock (RTC) shows how much each second in real time equals to the simulation time, based on the actual TR.</P>
<P>The Uptime panel shows the amount of time the simulation has been running based on real-world time.</P>


<P><i>Note 2: the increase/decrease speed button at the status bar of the main windows allows the user to adjust the TR of the simulation.</P>
