<H2 class="pageTitle">Tutorial - Step 4 : Mars Navigator</H2>

<P>The <A HREF="navigator.html">Mars Navigator</a> comes with two parts: the Mars globe and the Detail Map. 
It provides constant updates of your activities on the surface of Mars. </P> 

<P>Simply use your mouse to drag around the area inside either the Mars globe or the detailed map to take you 
where you want to see. </P>  

<P>In the detailed map, you may see various names of settlements, landmarks, vehicles and trip marks. </P>

<P>There are a total of 8 data layers that you may toggle on/off on the detailed map. </P>

<P>The mineral layer consumes a fair bit of processing power to obtain the correct mineral locations within an area.</P> 

<P>Players may consider un-checking it in order to lower the CPU usage. </i></P>

<P>Currently, there are 10 available minerals that settlers may be able to prospect and mine. </P>

<P>You may toggle on/off the appearance of each mineral on the detailed map. </P>

<P>To see the detail info of a base or a vehicle, hover over it until the crossmark appears. </P>

<P>Next, click on its overlaying label and its Unit Window will be opened up.</P>
