<P>The Science tool displays information about ongoing and finished scientific studies.</P>
<P>The top left list shows all ongoing studies and their current phase of completion.  
Phases for a study are "Study Proposal", "Collaborator Invitation", "Research", "Writing Paper", 
and "Peer Review" in chronological order.  </P>
<P>You can select a study and its information will be displayed in the study details panel on the right.</P>
<P>The bottom left list shows all finished studies and their completion status.  
A study can have "Successful Completion", "Failed Completion", or "Canceled" status.</P>  
<P>Successful Completion means that the study was fully completed and passed peer review.  </P>
<P>Failed Completion means that the study was fully completed but failed peer review.  </P>
<P>Canceled means that the study was canceled before completion, perhaps due to death of the primary researcher.  </P>
<P>You can select a study and its information will be displayed in the study details panel on the right.</P>

<P>The Study Details panel shows information about the selected scientific study.</P>

<P>The top panel displays general information about the study. 
Study Science shows the scientific field that the study primarily focuses on. </P>
<P>The Difficulty Level shows the difficulty and importance of the study. </P>
<P>It is determined by the primary researcher's skill level in the study science at the time the study is proposed. </P>
<P>The Status line shows the studies current phase or completion status.</P>
<P>The primary researcher panel shows a button with the study's primary researcher's name.  
Clicking on it opens an information dialog for the researcher. </P>

<P>The Scientific Field line shows what scientific field the researcher is focused on for the study. </P> 

<P>If the study is ongoing, the next line shows the researchers current study activity with a progress bar 
showing the current progress in work or time for that activity. </P>

<P>If the study is finished, the line shows the scientific achievement credit earned by the researcher for the study. </P>

<P>Only successfully completed studies will earn scientific achievement credit for researchers.</P>

<P>A scientific study may have up to three collaborating researchers, each displayed in a panel 
below the primary researcher's panel. </P>

<P>A collaborative researcher panel shows a button with the collaborator's name.</P>

<P> Clicking on it opens an information dialog for the researcher. </P>
