<H3>Discrete Event</H3>

<P>mars-sim is developed with a heuristic approach using both discrete event modeling and 
Agent-based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) for modeling the everyday decision of a settler in mars-sim.</P>

<P>Discrete event simulation is widely used throughout mars-sim for dividing a continuous 
process into discrete parts to simplify the modeling. 
For example, we break down the task of the greenhouse operation into 4 independent phases: 
tending the crop, inspecting the systems, cleaning the equipment, and sampling crop for lab analysis. </P>

<P>See http://www.anylogic.com/discrete-event-simulation for more info.</P>

<H3>Agent Modeling</H3>

<P>On the other hand, Agent Modeling and Simulation is a fairly new paradigm of computational 
modeling that we attempt to implement in a limited sense. </P>

<P>See http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Agent_based_modeling">Agent Base Modeling for more info.</P>

<P>In mars-sim, under the object-oriented approach, we have Person class as the blueprint for creating each settler as being an Java object that has many internal states and action methods.</P>

<P>These internal states are represented by discrete variables. These state variable(s) can affect 
the agent's behaviors (such as what tasks or missions to perform).</P>

<H3>Frames and Compression</H3>

<P>At the start of the simulation, it is set to run at 25 frames per second (FPS) or ticks per second (TPS)
 for each period of the game loop. Also, the time compression ratio is set as 1 real second to 
 8 simulation minutes and 30 seconds. Time compression ratio is how fast the simulation is running. User may
 change it with the Time Tool.</P>

<H3>Probability for Tasks and Missions</H3>

<P>On each frame, a probability score is computed for each settler for each possible task (and mission) 
that a person is capable of performing during his/her work shift and according to one's job and role
in the settlement.</P>

<P>While these scores are affected by a person's internal state, various environmental factors, as
well as the needs of the settlement collective, they represent the relative likelihood that this person 
will undertake a particular task or mission. </P>

<P>With some exceptions, the task or the mission with the highest score has the 
highest probability of being chosen by the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) in Java. </P>

<H3>Relationship</H3>

<P>Note that for now, our implementation of ABMS is somewhat limited and does NOT include a wide 
range of interactions between agents. </P>

<P>If a settler has a bad relationship with another settler, they are less likely to be work 
together as a team in a scientific research/experiment or heading out on a regolith/mining 
mission together. Nor will they want to seeing each other much within the same building. </P>
